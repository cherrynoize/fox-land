- click outside of search box makes unfocus and reset search box
  value (but not command)
- / or esc when search box is unfocused puts it into focus
- theme support by giving body class name of the theme (e.g:
  cyberpunk-neon-theme), in which we assign a var --primary,
  --secondary, --background, etc. to the theme colors, and
  setting all colors within the body to --primary, etc. variables
  (this way we can easily switch between themes by just changing
  the body's class to a different "-theme" class.)
